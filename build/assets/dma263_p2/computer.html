                  <article class="articleText">
                    <p>
    				  The short answer: Yes, although you may need a special cable depending on what type of input/output ports you’re working with.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    				  All modern HDTVs have HDMI inputs—some older HDTVs have DVI inputs instead—and some have VGA inputs for “PC use.”
    				  If your graphics card has an HDMI output, you’re good to go: Just use an HDMI cable to connect your PC to your HDTV.
    				  If your graphics card only has DVI outputs, I suggest snagging a cheap HDMI-to-DVI cable and plugging it into your HDTV’s HDMI input.
    				  Although some HDTVs (and some graphics cards) have VGA inputs/outputs, this is not the ideal choice—it’s an analog signal that will give you a far fuzzier, lower-resolution image than an HDMI or DVI signal.
    				</p>
                  </article>
                  <h2><i class="material-icons left">tv</i> Will it look good?</h2>
    			  <article class="articleText">
    				<p>
    				  Maybe, but this depends on a number of factors, including what you want to use your HDTV monitor for. Most reasonably-priced HDTVs top out at 1080p, or 1920-by-1080 pixel resolution. But 4K/UHD, or 3840-by-2160 pixel resolution, is dropping price each generation. On a 15.6-inch laptop screen,
    				  the Windows desktop at 1080p looks pretty darn good from a couple of feet away. On a 32-inch HDTV screen…not so much. Definitely have to consider a higher resolution.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    				  What’s important here is pixel density, or the number of pixels packed into one square inch of the screen. A 15.6-inch laptop screen
    				  has the same number of pixels as the 32-inch HDTV screen, but the laptop has a much higher pixel density (141.21ppi) than does the HDTV
    				  (68.84ppi). Thus, the laptop’s screen will appear clearer, sharper, and more detailed than the HDTV’s screen when viewed from the same
    				  distance. The importance of pixel density decreases with viewing distance; that’s why the iPhone’s “Retina” screen has a density of
    				  326ppi, while the MacBook Pro’s “Retina” screen has a density of just 227ppi.
    				</p>
    			  </article>
    			  <h2><i class="material-icons left">tv</i> Is it worth it?</h2>
    			  <article class="articleText">
    				<p>
    				  If you’re looking to get the best bang for your buck, an HDTV isn’t necessarily going to save you money over a monitor.
    				  In fact, if you’re purchasing a new display, I recommend sticking with the tried-and-true computer monitor. For one thing,
    				  smaller, cheaper HDTVs are typically 720p or lower featured 1080p resolution, not 4K, while similarly-priced monitors will almost always be at least 1440P or low end 4K.
    				  So if you’re looking for something under 27 inches, an HDTV will probably be more expensive.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    				  If you’re looking for something larger than 27 inches, remember that pixel density decreases significantly with every few
    				  inches you gain, and there’s a reason HDTV-makers suggest sitting several feet away from their creations. If you need a display
    				  that will multi-task as an up-close work/email display as well as movie/entertainment display, you’ll want something with a high
    				  enough pixel density that text won’t be a pain to read. At this point, 4K/UHD will be your only option for a HDTV as a computer monitor.

                  <h2><i class="material-icons left">star</i><span>OLED</span> - The BEST Choice</h2>
                  <article class="articleText">
                    <p>
    				  4K HDR OLED TVs might just be the very best televisions. A quick refresher on those acronyms helps explain why.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    				  4K refers to the sets’ diamond-sharp screen resolutions, of course. HDR (high dynamic range) uses a wider color
    				  gamut—and usually brighter backlights—to create more lifelike images. It’s beautiful, but you need content encoded
    				  for it and a TV designed for it, both of which are currently in short supply. OLED stands for “organic light-emitting diode,”
    				  and it’s widely considered the best display tech available. That’s because it offers the finest pixel-by-pixel contrast and
    				  the deepest blacks you’ll see without visiting space.
    				</p>
    				<p>
    				  All of which is to say a 4K HDR OLED TV will blow your mind, and charge you heavily for the privilege.
